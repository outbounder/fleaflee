# FLEAFLEE

A small tribute to a very old game which I was not been able to find in the internets for couple of hours.

So I decided to rebuild it with the help of chatGPT and my daugther.

Live version at https://outbounder.github.io/fleaflee/src/

## Dev setup

```
git clone git@github.com:outbounder/fleaflee.git
cd ./fleaflee
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Contributions

Issues, PRs & support are welcome.

## Copyright

I don't know who owns the rights of the original game. Google is not helping too. If you find it let me know and I'll either remove this repo or refactor it to comply with any copyright requirements. 

Until otherwise stated assume this as MIT licensed.
